AV000tWuGV-KLJ3ac2-b,Amazon,Amazon Devices,B01KIOU4EO,7,"the best echo yet, especially if you have elderly parents this was really worth the wait. i bought the echo show for my parents, who are elderly, and have a variety of ailments. since they have arthritis, and a few other issues, i didn't want them to go and answer the doorbell, just to find it's someone soliciting them to buy random junk. so, last year, i bought and installed the ring doorbell pro in their house, which works very well. the ring doorbell pro is hardwired and not battery operated. after the skill was enabled, i could tell alexa to show me the front doorbell and a video feed automatically pops up. you really need a good wi-fi router with the echo show as the video will be jerky since the video is very high quality. if you have a good wi-fi router, the video comes up very quickly and runs very smooth. i thought the doorbell would launch the app on the echo show automatically, but it does not. you have to initiate the connection yourself. hopefully this will be an option in the next iteration of this skill. i can think of a whole bunch of ideas for this skill to do, but for a very first implementation, it works great with the hardwired version of the ring doorbell pro.the battery powered ring products do not work as great though. when trying to connect the echo show to a battery powered ring device, i get a message saying something like, the camera is asleep and needs to wake up and it could take 30 sec. this happens with my ring stickup camera. so, if you want the best experience, you should buy the ring doorbell pro instead of the battery powered versions.one of my parents just came out of the hospital and sometimes just doesn't have the energy to even pick up a cell phone when we call. so, we have another echo show, just for her, in drop in mode.read more amazon",4.142857142857143

AV1T19kvglJLPUi8H8Y-,Amazon,Amazon Devices,B00ZS0G0PG,4,"ive loved both my paperwhite and voyage is the oasis worth the additional cost 2, update 7/24/16: after using my oasis for almost 3 months, i thought i would add a brief comment to my original review. i have settled on using the oasis for reading in bed, where it's lighter and easier to hold and i prefer the page turn button style. for my reading elsewhere, for example if i want to read while eating, i use my voyage w/origami case to hold it upright. i can read the same book using both kindles since they stay synch'd to one another, and it's given me basically the best of both worlds, at least for my style of reading. the voyage with cover almost seems clunky - bulkier and heavier - compared to the oasis, but when it's sitting on a table it hardly matters. i have to say that i'm fortunate in being able to afford both, and the new base model kindle that i recently picked up is not yet getting much use, even though much of my reading is in lighting conditions where the non-illuminated display works just fine. my original review follows.---------amazon released the first kindle in november of 2007. eight and a half years later, the oasis model is the 8th generation kindle and the third evolution of kindle with built-in illumination. the price of 300+ was a bit of a shock, but i ordered mine as soon as it was announced on april 13th. i then spent the next two weeks reading what was available online describing the features and benefits and asking myself whether or not i had made the right decision. now that its finally been released and i have it in my hands, how different is it, and is it worth what appears at first to be a very high price(my kindle experience: i purchased my first kindle (a first generation paperwhite), when it was first released in sept 2012. i purchased the voyage when it was first released, in sept 2014.read more amazon",4.5

AVzRkFTFvKc47QAVd43-,Amazon,"Amazon Devices,Kindle Store",B071NMTDHR,18,"a nice case that works well to protect your tablet! this is a good case that provides adequate protection for your new 8 inch 2017 kindle fire. inside it features a plastic frame that you snap your kindle into. the frame solidly holds your kindle into place and also covers the corners of the tablet and protects it during drops. the case weighs in at 4.66 ounces.the exterior of the case is a fiber cover that looks stylish. it is available in canary yellow, charcoal black, cobalt blue, marine blue and punch red. the one in my video is marine blue. the top cover has magnets in it that hold the cover closed and also tightly attach it to the back surface of the case when the cover is fully opened.the cover also has magnets in it that turn off the tablet when you close the cover and turn it on when you open the cover. i like that feature as it helps to conserve battery power. the inside surface of the cover is a micro fiber material and that protects your tablet screen from scratches when the cover is closed.i like that the micro sd card slot is covered when the tablet is installed in the case. that helps to protect the sd card from being lost or quickly stolen. a large memory size sd card can cost 47 to almost 100 and the added security is helpful.the tablets speakers are uncovered when the tablet is opened and when it is properly stood up in the landscape mode so you can watch a video. i show this in my product video. all of the top controls and ports are available while the tablet is in the case. that includes the volume controls, the headphone jack, the microphone, the power charging port and the power on/off button.the cover flap can be partially folded to allow you to stand the tablet into the portrait mode or in the landscape mode for reading, browsing the internet or watching movies.read more amazon",3.5555555555555554
AVzRlo37glJLPUi8FbPy,Amazon,"Amazon Devices,Kindle Store",B01LW1MS9C,10,"great upgrade for aesthetics i'm a huge fan of the echo family. i have two echo's, three dots and one tap. no they aren't essential to my life but i love playing music, listening to the news and controlling the philips hue smart lights throughout my home. it was a large investment that most of the population won't make - with that being said i am not a huge fan of the way the hockey puck dots look like. glossy plastic looks a little cheap to me although it has no effect on the performance of them. having the dot cover is a great option and it looks fantastic.some reviewers say they look cheap or fit too loose - i'm not sure why people are moving their dots. since dots are made to be stationary, have a loose fitting cover isn't an issue. to me, it fits perfectly. they also aren't made of real fabric, but the important part is that it does look like the fabric in the picture. not being fabric is a better option considering plastic is much more durable than material and will hold its color better if your dot happens to get sunlight.i bought three covers - blue, grey and white. they all look good but the grey is my favorite as it doesn't attract more attention than it needs to. with that being said, i like all three colors.edit 07/11/2017 - these covers hold up well over time. mine haven't collected dust or faded. i've kept them on for over half a year and not a single issue (not that i'd expect any besides possible fading). amazon",4.7
AVzRloqLGV-KLJ3aavBd,Amazon,"Amazon Devices,Kindle Store",B07194GPJV,25,"a great choice for a good looking and durable case to protect the new 7 fire tablet over the years, i've tried a variety of cases for the various models of kindle and fire tablet that i've purchased from amazon. while i've found a few third party covers that have been durable and attractive, i found myself coming back to amazon's own product when i purchased one of their new 7 fire tablets, and i'm pleased with it.this is a very good quality cover, it fits well, and it provides support to the tablet both in landscape and portrait orientation. it's made of fabric on the outside, with a microfiber inner lining to protect the screen of the tablet when the cover is closed. it matches the color of the fire tablet perfectly.my only hesitation in purchasing it was the price - the case all by itself is fully half the price of the fire tablet! but i suppose that says more about how cheap the tablet is, than how expensive the case is (kind of).still, i decided to spend the money for this case. the tablet needs the protection and i know from experience that amazon's cases are durable and will last for a long time (i've used my original kindle paperwhite - first generation model - with case since it was first purchased).i'll post some photos of the cover to show how it is packaged and how it looks on the tablet. i'm very satisfied with it. amazon",3.68
